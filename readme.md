**vfile** is a small and browser friendly virtual file format that tracks
metadata (such as a fileâ€™s `path` and `value`) and [messages][].

It was made specifically for **[unified][]** and generally for the common task
of parsing, transforming, and serializing data, where `vfile` handles everything
about the document being compiled.
This is useful for example when building linters, compilers, static site
generators, or other build tools.
**vfile** is part of the [unified collective][site].
